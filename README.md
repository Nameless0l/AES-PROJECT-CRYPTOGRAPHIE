# AES-PROJECT-CRYPTOGRAPHIE
# AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) Project

This is a school project for implementing the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. The project consists of several source files and directories.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

- `src`: Directory containing the source code files.
- `bing`: Directory for storing binary image files.
- `main.c`: Main program file.
- `function.c`: Source code file for implementing various AES functions.
- `constants.c`: Source code file containing constant values used in the AES algorithm.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the source code files.
4. Run the executable file.

## Usage

Provide instructions here on how to use the AES functionality implemented in your project. Include any command-line arguments, input/output formats, and examples.
